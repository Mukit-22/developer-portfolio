                <p>A full stack web developer is a person who can develop both client and server software.

                    In addition to mastering HTML and CSS, he/she also knows how to:

                    Program a browser (like using JavaScript, jQuery, Angular, or Vue)
                    Program a server (like using PHP, ASP, Python, or Node)
                    Program a database (like using SQL, SQLite, or MongoDB)</p>

                <p>Are you a noob in all the fields of CS and want fast results with less studying? I was the same a few
                    months ago and honestly, the beginning results in web development were astounding. I have painfully
                    come
                    to the realization that development is not confined to just showing beautiful things on a browser.
                    It
                    also involves the painstaking process of writing code that links innumerable pages and styles and
                    most
                    of the times, none of it works together. </p>
